### 1. Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
An *Interpreted Language* is a cross-platform language that reads and runs the programms line by line. This means we can change a command and see the result immediately. Even though this can be slower, it allows programmers to fix bugs or errors easier.

On the other hand, a *Compiled Language* is a non cross-platform language that is directly converted into machine code. These languages have to be manually compiled first; if we want to make a change in the code, we have to re-build the entire program.
